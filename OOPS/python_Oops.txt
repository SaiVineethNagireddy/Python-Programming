Object Oriented programming
    OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.Python is an object-oriented language, allowing you to structure your code using classes and objects for better organization and reusability.

Advantages of OOP:
    Provides a clear structure to programs
    Makes code easier to maintain, reuse, and debug
    Helps keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
    Allows you to build reusable applications with less code

Classes and Objects:
    Classes and objects are the two core concepts in object-oriented programming.
      A class defines what an object should look like, and an object is created based on that class. For example:
        Class	 Objects
        Fruit  - Apple, Banana, Mango
        Car	   - Volvo, Audi, Toyota

Python __init__() Method:
    All classes have a built-in method called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.The __init__() method is used to assign values to object properties, or to perform operations that are necessary when the object is being created.

The self Parameter:
    The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class.It is used to access properties and methods that belong to the class.

Python Class Properties:
    Properties are variables that belong to a class. They store data for each object created from the class.
    Example:
            class Person:
                def __init__(self, name, age):
                    self.name = name
                    self.age = age

                p1 = Person("Emil", 36)

                print(p1.name)
                print(p1.age)

Python Class Methods:
    Methods are functions that belong to a class. They define the behavior of objects created from the class.
    Example: 
            class Person:
                def __init__(self, name):
                    self.name = name

                def greet(self):
                    print("Hello, my name is " + self.name)

                p1 = Person("sai")
                p1.greet()

Python Inheritance:
    Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.    
    Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
    Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

Python Polymorphism:
    The word "polymorphism" means "many forms", and in programming it refers to methods/functions/operators with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes.

Python Encapsulation
    Encapsulation is about protecting data inside a class.
    It means keeping data (properties) and methods together in a class, while controlling how the data can be accessed from outside the class.
    This prevents accidental changes to your data and hides the internal details of how your class works.
